# Normobaric Hypoxia Training Budget Calculator

## Description

The **Normobaric Hypoxia Training Budget Calculator** is a Python script designed to estimate the gas consumption and budget required for a normobaric hypoxia training program. It calculates the weekly and total costs associated with using compressed air, nitrogen, and oxygen gases, and integrates physiological parameters to adjust ventilation rates based on altitude.

This tool is ideal for aviation training centers, sports facilities, or any organization that conducts hypoxia training sessions simulating high-altitude conditions.

## Features

- **Physiological Integration**: Calculates physiological parameters for an average adult at different altitudes, including atmospheric pressure, partial pressure of oxygen, arterial oxygen saturation, ventilation rate, and heart rate.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to input or accept default values for:
  - Number of students per week
  - Number of weeks for the training program
  - Session duration
  - Recovery duration
  - Simulated altitude
  - Duration at altitude
  - Gas prices (Compressed Air, Nitrogen, Oxygen)
  - Contingency percentage
- **Accurate Cost Estimation**: Provides detailed budget summaries, including weekly and total gas consumption and costs, accounting for contingency.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
